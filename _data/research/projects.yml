  text: "Gromov-Wasserstein is an Optimal Transport metric designed to align heterogeneous distributions. We have shown it could be used to compare graphs and proposed a sliced version to overcome its computational burden."

- title: Machine Learning for Earth Observation
  image: map_cropped.png
  text: "A lot of earth observation data are timestamped. Designing ML techniques that can handle this time dimension can often lead to much improved performance. We have so far turned our focus on 3 different types of environmental data: chemistry data in streams, remote sensing data (such as satellite image time series) and ship trajectory data."

- title: Time-Sensitive Graphical Models
  image: hdlsm-supervised.svg
  text: "We have been using time-sensitive topic models (such as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Motifs or Hierarchical Dirichlet Latent Semantic Motifs) to perform action recognition in videos. More recently, we have turned our focus towards the design of richer models to better model continuous processes in continuous time."

- title: Indexing &amp; IR [Past]
  image: lbub.svg
  text: "Our main goal in this project was to introduce new indexing schemes that were able to efficiently deal with time series. One contribution in this field was iSAX+, an approximate-lower-bound-based indexing scheme for DTW. Some works about vector data indexing are also cited here."

- title: Time Series Mining for Smart Environments [Past]
  image: smartenv.png
  text: "The growing use of lots of low-level sensors instead of few higher-level ones implies the use of dedicated pattern extraction methods. To do so, we have worked on the already existing T-patterns algorithm so that it can efficiently scale up to larger volumes of data."
