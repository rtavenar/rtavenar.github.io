  title: "Human motion analysis for clinical and sports applications"
  abstract: "Movement analysis based on technological tools can often complement and improve clinical assessments performed by health professionals. This is notably true for the assessment of fall risk. Unfortunately, technological tools  are often costly, as well as time- and space-consuming, which limits their actual use. I will present an approach combining an ambient sensor and machine learning algorithms in order to automate clinical assessment and make its use more convenient and affordable. Beyond clinical assessment, this approach can be used to improve prevention in ecological environments. In particular, I will show how our approach can be used to assess fall risk at home by extracting behavioral parameters in daily activities. Finally, I will show how movement analysis can be combined to virtual environments to try to increase the engagement of athletes in a treadmill-running task."

  title: "Prediction and influence of the occurrence of events in complex sequences"
  abstract: "For several years now, a new phenomenon related to digital data is emerging: data which is increasingly voluminous, varied and rapid, appears and becomes available, it is often referred to as complex data. Complex data is very rich in hidden information, which increases its predictive and detection power. For many years, prediction and detection models in the data mining literature have been proposed for so-called simple data (from a single source, with a clear structure, etc.). However, the generalization and predominance of complex data leads to new challenges, mainly related to taking into account the new characteristics of this data in the modeling process. Consequently, proposing new models adapted to complex data has become essential to better detect, predict and even influence the future, which represents the main challenge that I have chosen to address during my research. This presentation covers my contributions for mining complex data, with a focus on complex sequences, by proposing models for: (i) events prediction, (ii) emergence detection, (iii) events influence and (iv) anomaly detection."

  title: "Science des données et apprentissage statistique pour l'extraction de connaissances à partir de données et d'images"
  abstract: "Dans le cadre de ce séminaire, je présenterai une partie de mes travaux de recherche portant sur l'utilisation de méthodes de sciences des données et d'apprentissage statistique (machine/deep-learning, modélisation/fouille/visualisation de données) pour l’extraction de connaissances à partir de données et d’images.

Les premiers travaux que je présenterai porteront sur l'utilisation du transfert d'apprentissage pour la détection de structure au sein de documents manuscrits historiques, en l'absence de vérité-terrain.
J’exposerai ensuite mes travaux sur la ré-identification de véhicules par l'utilisation des espaces latents de réseaux convolutifs profonds.
Je finirai sur la présentation des différents travaux que je mène actuellement sur la modélisation, la fouille et la visualisation de (méta-)données hétérogènes issues des systèmes de vidéoprotection."

  title: "Application placement on Clouds, Edge and other Hybrid Infrastructures: a journey."
  abstract: "In this presentation I will present my recent work on application placement on hybrid infrastructures. First
I will discuss an approach for modeling and calculating distributed application placement on very large 
multi-cloud infrastructures based on efficient bin-packing and graph-homomorphism 
heuristics. Then I will move to a discussion about challenges related to placing distributed applications
on Edge infrastructures. In special, I discuss current work on (i) a first approach for the placement of 
stream processing applications and (ii) benchmarking Edge processing frameworks.
Finally, I close the presentation with two collaboration projects where Edge computing and application placement
have an central role."

  title: "Graph of keypoints for remote sensing image analysis"
  abstract: "We present a novel graph-based approach for remote sensing image analysis. In such an approach, keypoints are first extracted to represent and characterize the image. A similarity graph is then constructed from these points and the analysis from the graph’s spatial and spectral domains provides us powerful tools to tackle different remote sensing tasks. Our approach does not require any stationary condition within remote sensing imagery and is able to deal with large-size image data. Some examples on classification of optical satellite images, change detection and glacier flow measurement from synthetic radar aperture (SAR) data are illustrated in order to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."
