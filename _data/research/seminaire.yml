  title: "Human motion analysis for clinical and sports applications"
  abstract: "Movement analysis based on technological tools can often complement and improve clinical assessments performed by health professionals. This is notably true for the assessment of fall risk. Unfortunately, technological tools  are often costly, as well as time- and space-consuming, which limits their actual use. I will present an approach combining an ambient sensor and machine learning algorithms in order to automate clinical assessment and make its use more convenient and affordable. Beyond clinical assessment, this approach can be used to improve prevention in ecological environments. In particular, I will show how our approach can be used to assess fall risk at home by extracting behavioral parameters in daily activities. Finally, I will show how movement analysis can be combined to virtual environments to try to increase the engagement of athletes in a treadmill-running task."
